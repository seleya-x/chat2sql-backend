# Supabase Environment Variables Setup

Please create a .env file in this directory with the following content:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://funaizcaqsbhxafbmmyq.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_from_dashboard
```

IMPORTANT: The key you provided is the anon key, not the service role key. 
The service role key is different and has higher privileges.

To find your service role key:
1. Go to the Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Project Settings" > "API"
4. Scroll down to "Project API keys"
5. Look for "service_role key" (it will be hidden)
6. Click "Reveal" to see the key

After creating the .env file, uncomment the admin routes in agent-server.js:
- Uncomment line 6: const adminRoutes = require('./admin-handlers');
- Uncomment line 14: app.use('/api/admin', adminRoutes);

Then restart the backend server.
